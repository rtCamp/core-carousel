## Requirements

| Requirement | Minimum      | Recommended |

| WordPress   | 6.5+         | 6.6+        |
| PHP         | 7.4+         | 8.2+        |

> **Note:** The Interactivity API became stable in WordPress 6.5. This plugin works with WordPress core—no Gutenberg plugin required.

## Browser Support

Carousel Kit supports all modern browsers:

> **Note:** Internet Explorer is not supported. The plugin requires ES2020+ features (optional chaining, nullish coalescing) and CSS custom properties.

## Block Structure

The plugin provides a suite of blocks that work together:

1.  **Carousel (Parent)**: The main wrapper and controller.
2.  **Carousel Viewport**: The visible area that handles scrolling.
3.  **Carousel Slide**: A wrapper for individual slides.
4.  **Carousel Controls**: Previous/Next buttons.
5.  **Carousel Dots**: Pagination indicators.

## FAQ

### Does it work with Full Site Editing (FSE)?

Yes! Carousel Kit is fully compatible with Full Site Editing. You can use the carousel block in templates, template parts, and anywhere blocks are supported.

### Can I nest other blocks inside slides?

Absolutely. Each slide is a container that accepts any WordPress block—images, paragraphs, groups, columns, and even other third-party blocks.

### Does it support the Query Loop block?

Yes. Simply add a Query Loop block inside the Carousel Viewport, and each post in the loop becomes a slide automatically. No special configuration needed.

### Is it accessible?

Yes. The carousel follows W3C accessibility guidelines with proper ARIA roles, labels, and full keyboard navigation support.

### Can I have multiple carousels on the same page?

Yes. Each carousel instance maintains its own independent state.

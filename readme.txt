A modular, high-performance carousel block for WordPress, powered by the Interactivity API and Embla Carousel.

== Description ==

**Carousel Kit** is a flexible, accessible carousel block for the WordPress block editor. Build dynamic carousels for posts, testimonials, images, and more—without writing code.

= Features =

* **Compound Block Architecture** – Mix and match any blocks inside the carousel
* **High Performance** – Powered by Embla Carousel v8
* **Interactivity API** – Reactive state management with zero hydration overhead
* **Query Loop Support** – Each post in a Query Loop becomes a slide automatically

* **RTL Support** – Built-in support for Right-to-Left languages

= Block Components =

1. **Carousel** – The main wrapper and controller
2. **Carousel Viewport** – The visible scrolling area
3. **Carousel Slide** – Container for individual slides
4. **Carousel Controls** – Previous/Next navigation buttons
5. **Carousel Dots** – Pagination indicators

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with Full Site Editing? =

Absolutely. Each slide accepts any WordPress block—images, paragraphs, groups, columns, and third-party blocks.

= Does it support the Query Loop block? =

Yes. Add a Query Loop inside the Carousel Viewport, and each post becomes a slide automatically.
